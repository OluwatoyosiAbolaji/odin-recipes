# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a simple project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice basic HTML skills. This project is a static website that contains several recipe pages, each detailing ingredients and instructions for different dishes. It serves as a foundation for learning the structure of HTML documents and how to link multiple web pages together.

## Project Features

- Home page with links to different recipes.
- Multiple recipe pages, each containing:
  - A title of the dish.
  - A list of ingredients.
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions.
- Basic HTML structure using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
- No external libraries or frameworks, just pure HTML.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For structuring the content of the web pages.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/odin-recipes.git
