			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p><em>Lasagna</em> is a <em>classic Italian dish</em> made by layering sheets of pasta with rich, flavorful fillings. Typically, it includes alternating layers of a savory meat sauce, often made with ground beef or sausage simmered in tomatoes and aromatic herbs like garlic and oregano, paired with creamy ricotta or b√©chamel sauce. Melted mozzarella and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese top each layer, creating a golden, bubbly crust when baked. The pasta absorbs the sauces, making every bite hearty and satisfying. Lasagna can also be made <em>vegetarian</em> by using roasted vegetables like zucchini, spinach, or mushrooms in place of meat.</p>

			<h3>Steps</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
				<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
				<li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 2 minutes. Add ground turkey and cook 5 to 7 minutes more, stirring to break up any large chunks of meat. Stir in tomato sauce, mushrooms, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and garlic powder. Simmer for 2 minutes and season to taste.</li>
				<li>Combine spinach, ricotta, and nutmeg in a large bowl.</li>
				<li>To assemble, arrange 3 noodles lengthwise in the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Spread with 1/3 the ricotta mixture, 1/3 of the turkey mixture, and 1/3 of the mozzarella. Repeat layers, ending with remaining mozzarella. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
