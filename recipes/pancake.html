      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Pancake</em> is a popular breakfast dish made from a simple batter of
        flour, eggs, milk, and butter, cooked on a griddle or skillet until
        golden brown. They are light, fluffy, and slightly crisp on the edges.
        Often stacked and served warm, pancakes can be enjoyed with a variety of
        toppings such as butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or
        even chocolate chips. Their versatility allows for savory variations as
        well, using ingredients like bacon, cheese, or herbs. Soft and
        comforting, pancakes are a timeless favorite for <em>morning meals or
        brunch.</em>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
          Mix together mashed potatoes, potato starch, egg, salt, pepper, garlic
          powder, and 1 teaspoon of the chives in a medium bowl until combined.
          The mixture should be slightly sticky but not loose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over
          medium-high heat until hot and oil is fragrant. Spoon potato mixture
          into skillet and press it into an even layer to create a potato
          pancake about 9 inches in diameter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to medium; cover skillet with a lid or flat cookie sheet
          and cook, giving skillet a 90-degree turn every 2 to 3 minutes, until
          golden brown around the edges and top of pancake feels almost dry to
          the touch, 8 to 9 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slide potato pancake onto a large plate. Spray another large plate
          with nonstick cooking spray and invert the potato pancake onto greased
          plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil to skillet and heat over medium. Slide
          pancake back into skillet and cook, uncovered, until golden brown on
          the other side, about 5 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slide pancake onto a cutting board and garnish with remaining 1
          teaspoon chives.
        </li>
        <li>Slice into 8 wedges and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
