			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p><em>Pizza</em> is a beloved dish that originated in </em>Italy</em> and has since become a <em>global favorite</em>. It consists of a round, flat crust made from dough, typically topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients. Classic toppings include pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and olives, while more creative varieties might feature ingredients like arugula, prosciutto, or pineapple. The crust can range from thin and crispy to thick and chewy, depending on regional styles. Once baked, the cheese melts into a gooey layer, and the toppings blend with the sauce, creating a savory, mouthwatering combination in every slice.</p>
